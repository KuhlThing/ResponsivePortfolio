As a hopeful web development professional, I want an elegant, informative portfolio page so that potential employers can see if I am a match for their companies.

I opted for a minimalist style. Keeping clutter to a minimum and functionality forward represents my coding style very well. Potential employers need to be able to see what I can do, and how I do it. This profile is easily readable, with links provided for my GitHub page, LinkedIn profile, email, a pdf of my resume, and a few deployed applications. There is also a contact page form to reach out directly from the page.
